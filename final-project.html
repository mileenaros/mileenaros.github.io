            <h1>Mileena's Final Project: Alarm Lamp</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
            <br>Concept and Motivation: Have you ever slept through your alarm? Do you
            <br>ever wake up to the sound of your alarm incredibly irritated? Does
            <br>your alarm ever interrupt your cool dreams? For me, the answer to all
            <br>of those questions is YES.
            <br><br>
            <br>I created the Alarm Lamp in order to address these issues. The inspiration
            <br>behind Alarm Lamp is how my roommate used to turn on the lights while I was
            <br>sleeping early in the morning, and I would wake up gradually and usually
            <br>happily, much earlier than the alarm I had set on my phone. Similarly, it's
            <br>usually hard to sleep when the sun or streetlights are shining in your face.
            <br><br>
            <br>The aesthetic/external design of Alarm Lamp is inspired by @leahsfieldnotes
            <br>on YouTube!
            <br><br>
            <br>There are a few things I wanted to achieve with my circuitry and firmware
            <br>when I conceptualized Alarm Lamp:
            <br> - Turn on when I want to wake up
            <br> - Turn/be off when I go to sleep
            <br> - Use different levels of brightness to contribute to the sleep schedule
            <br>I want
            <br> - Use different levels of brightness in response to the brightness of
            <br>the room (since I can utilize natural light or other lamps as well and don't want
            <br>my room to be TOO bright)
            <br> - Turn on/off completely (i.e., no alarm) using a button
            <br><br>
            <br> The functionality of Alarm Lamp that I implemented is as follows:
            <br>1. At wakeup time, the lamp will turn on at maximum brightness for one hour
            <br>2. After the wakeup hour is over, the brightness of the lamp is relative to 
            <br>the measured light levels of the room.
            <br>3. One hour prior to bedtime, the lamp will be set to a dim brightness to encourage
            <br>wind down time.
            <br>4. An on/off button can turn the entire Alarm Lamp off (will not turn on at wakeup
            <br>or throughout the day)
            <br><br>
            <br>Features and Implentation:
            <br>Alarm Clock: Real Time Clock Module (DS1307)
            <br>On/Off: Button
            <br>Light: LED strips
            <br>Light Measurement: Photoresistor
            <br><br>
            <br>Resistors/Calculations:
            <br>The circuit uses 10K ohm resistors for both the photoresistor and button.
            <br>The button utilizes this level so that the electrons have a path to ground when
            <br>the switch is open and we thus measure 0V.
            <br>The photoresistor uses this level by the following calculations:
            <br>Photoresistor = approx. 10K ohms resistance at 10 lux.
            <br>V_out = V_in * R_2 / (R_1 + R_2)
            <br>V_in = 5V; R_1 = 1OK ohms
            <br>Choosing a 10K ohm resistor for R_2 (i.e., R_2 = R_1) gives: V_out = 1/2 * V_in = 2.5V
            <br>If photoresistor resistance is 0 ohms then: V_out = 1 * V_in = 5V
            <br>Thus we have a measurable range of 2.5-5V at the voltage divider at pin A0
            <br><br>
            <br>Code:
            <br>The logic of my code follows this flow:
            <br>Is the system on or off? (input from button)
            <br>If the system is off: do not turn LEDs on.
            <br>If the system is on: check the current time and see if it is in the range of the wake up time and bedtime
            <br>set by the user. (data from RTC module and libraries)
            <br>If not in the user's wake-up to bedtime range: do not turn LEDs on.
            <br>If in the user's wake-up to bedtime range: check if the current time is
            <br> - the user's alarm to one hour after: set LEDs to max brightness
            <br> - one hour before the user's bedtime to the bedtime: set LEDs to dim level of brightness
            <br>If the time is not in either range: set LED to brightness determined by measured levels of
            <br>brightness (input from photoresistor). Dim room => bright lamp. Bright room => dim lamp.
